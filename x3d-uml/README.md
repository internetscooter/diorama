X3D-UML: User-Centred Design, Implementation and Evaluation of 3D UML Using X3D

Citation: "Dr Paul McIntosh has completed a user-centred study into combining 3D graphics and UML for describing software systems. For his PhD he developed a unique X3D-UML system, based on X3D and UML standards.  He adapted a sequential evaluation methodology and applied this with his X3D-UML application, to test and evaluate 3D UML. He has successfully applied his X3D-UML system to state machine diagrams and to mechatronic robots, highlighting the benefits and issues of using 3D in this way."
