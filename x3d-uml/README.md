# X3D-UML: User-Centred Design, Implementation and Evaluation of 3D UML Using X3D

Citation: "Dr Paul McIntosh has completed a user-centred study into combining 3D graphics and UML for describing software systems. For his PhD he developed a unique X3D-UML system, based on X3D and UML standards.  He adapted a sequential evaluation methodology and applied this with his X3D-UML application, to test and evaluate 3D UML. He has successfully applied his X3D-UML system to state machine diagrams and to mechatronic robots, highlighting the benefits and issues of using 3D in this way."

# X3D-UML Background

The idea of using game technology for serious software engineering tasks has been attempted many times. Despite this, game technology has not been a serious consideration in computer science. The primary reasons for this are the difficulty in using the technology and the lack of understanding of how to apply the technology to be useful and useable. Despite computer science underpinning game technology, game technology is not leveraged to make computer science easier.

The X3D-UML research sought to address the issue of how to design, implement and evaluate the serious use of 3D interfaces for computer software. To do this the research applied a systematic approach to the problem. Rather than creating a “concept” and then “start looking for a problem for it to solve”, effort was spent first understanding the actual problems of real-life software engineers and used a sequential approach to then apply and evaluate the most appropriate means of using 3D technology to address the problems.

As part of this research a prototype 3D user interface technology was created, which allowed software engineers’ within the study to use it to work with software. With this 3D user interface technology engineers are able to view software diagrams in ways that could not do before. They can work with them in a 3D space and manipulate them in ways not possible with 2D to suit the areas they are working. The examples below show how we use 3D game technology to understand how different parts of a computer program work together and how the software inside a robot works.
